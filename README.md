# Saguaro
The Design System behind Tentrr, the dirt simple way to camp. The purpose of this system and this project is to promote consistency in the way interfaces and experiences are built. It's also about adhering to a set of design standards, principle, and best practices to help craft what we, as Tentrr, want to communicate as our design language.

#### Web docs
Eventually, this system will (hopefully) be migrated to a URL ([design.tentrr.com](https://design.tentrr.com "design.tentrr.com")) to have accessible documentation to make development simpler and remove unnecessary guesswork from our process.

## Desgin assets
For anyone looking for the super awesome, *non-technical but still technical* designer stuff, check out the [Saguaro Design Library](https://github.com/zpfreed/project-saguaro-library "Saguaro Library") to start messing around with the UI system and the assets that fall under it.

Those assets are:
- a primary [Sketch file](https://design.tentrr.com "Sketch file")
- a [color library](https://design.tentrr.com "color library")
- a [typography library](https://design.tentrr.com "typography library")
- and an [icon library](https://design.tentrr.com "icon library")

They all work in tandem on the primary [Sketch file](https://design.tentrr.com "Sketch file"), so you don't have to keep checking it in and out, and can commit updates without disrupting the rest of the document. Smaller degree of error = happy design team.



## Contributing
Design really is a team sport, and we're hugely open to contributions to Saguaro! Eventually, this will be opened up for commits and suggestions...definitely will announce that when it happens.
